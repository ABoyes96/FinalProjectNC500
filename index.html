                <p>The Scottish Highlands beckon with their dramatic landscapes and hidden treasures. Discover the astonishing Whaligoe Steps, where 365 hand-carved stone steps cascade down sheer cliffs to a natural harbor that once bustled with fishing activity. Nearby, Smoo Cave impresses with Scotland's largest sea cave entrance, featuring multiple chambers and a magnificent waterfall perfect for exploration.
                    Experience the fairytale splendor of Dunrobin Castle, whose French-inspired turrets and formal gardens transport visitors to another era. For natural beauty, Clachtoll Beach offers pristine white sands and turquoise waters that rival tropical destinations, while Dunnett Head—mainland Britain's northernmost point—provides breathtaking panoramic views across the Pentland Firth.
                    Adventure seekers should not miss Sandwood Bay's mile-long stretch of pink-hued sand, accessible only by foot and offering true wilderness solitude. Throughout the Highlands, you'll encounter geological wonders, ancient ruins, and cultural landmarks that tell the story of Scotland's rich heritage.
